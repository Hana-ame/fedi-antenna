# environment

for some reason i don't even know what is `npm` and what is `npx`

i don't know why 
```sh
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```
and why 
```sh
npm create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```
doesn't work

## npx

after install it gives such message. 
```sh
  npm run dev
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Builds the app for production.

  npm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd nextjs-dashboard
  npm run dev
```
