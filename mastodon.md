for some reason it should ...

it cannot run in a local application mode. so how to download and sava the satatueses.

you can access the note's parents and children. just visit every very root, therefore you can get every children.

but for the first time, you should unblock the account first.

can it be in the local browser? local browser is always the one cannot access any local sqlite.db.

so the steps are here.
- requset for archive.
- select every note that @HaruUrara.
- request for it's context. (maybe should be slower for not to abuse the server)
- save to sqlite. (the types can be reused in viewing it.)
- check it twice
- finally, delete the account.

here is 4 accounts remains.
- pawoo.net
- mona.do
- bgme.me
- wxw.moe
- retirenow.top

retirenow should block HaruUrara, for she unfollowed you.
